# ðŸ”’ Secure Text Encryptor

A client-side web application that allows you to securely encrypt and decrypt text using the Web Crypto API. All encryption/decryption happens in your browser - no data is sent to any server.

## Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Uses AES-GCM 256-bit encryption
- **Password-Based**: Securely derives encryption keys from your password
- **Client-Side**: All processing happens in your browser
- **No Dependencies**: Pure JavaScript with Web Crypto API
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices

## How It Works

1. Enter your text in the input area
2. Provide a strong password (remember this for decryption)
3. Click "Encrypt" to encrypt your text
4. To decrypt, paste the encrypted text, enter the same password, and click "Decrypt"

## Security Notes

- The encryption key is derived from your password using PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- A random salt and initialization vector (IV) are generated for each encryption
- The encrypted output includes the salt and IV needed for decryption
- Your password is never stored or transmitted anywhere
